            Mali Thai Bistro is family-owned. Chef Nutnisa,pronounced
            "Nut-Neesa", Hoffman is from northeast Thailand. She grew up in a
            family where cooking was a passion. Her brothers and sisters all
            learned to cook from their mother and father. They learned recipes
            handed down from generation-to-generation. This passion for cooking
            led each of Chef Nutnisa's older sisters to open restaurants in
            Thailand, one in Bangkok and one on the island Koh Samui.

            Dream of owning her own restaurant came true in June 2015 when Doug
            and Nutnisa Hoffman opened the Mali Thai Bistro, located right off
            Highway 291 North, just north of Lee's Summit HighSchool. Mali Thai
            Bistro was named in honor of Chef Nutnisaâ€™s mother, with Mali being
            the name of a jasmine flower that she loved.
